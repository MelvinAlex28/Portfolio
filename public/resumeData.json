    "bio":"I am a professional programmer with profound knowledge in python, java and software development gained from my master’s and bachelor’s studies as a computer science student. I was Front End Developer Intern at Don Bosco Institute of technology during my bachelor’s studies. From my expertise seen in these programming languages and the number of experiences gained through my internship and the various projects done I find myself learning, often to the degree of obsession. The better I get the more I realize that I do not know much, and I am always on the path of catching up. I believe just like an AI one should be constantly learning and apply those technically to gain practical experience.",
